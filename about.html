      <p>“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people do not know.”
        Sherlock Holmes explains my major interest in his great quote.
        I want to be a data-driven detective whose passion lies in uncovering the unknown. My business is to know what others do not, to delve into the depths of problems, and unearth the evidence that leads to their solutions.
        As a detective, I am driven by the thrill of the chase, the pursuit of hidden causes and effects. With each case, I sharpen my skills, honing my craft and seeking new ways to unravel the mysteries that others cannot solve.
        My journey to becoming a master problem-solver is ongoing, and I know that there is still much to learn. But I am determined to keep pushing forward, tackling my own challenges before taking on those of others.
        As a creative, team-oriented individual, I am always eager to take on new challenges and risks. With a strong work ethic, a high level of responsibility, and persistence, I am ready for whatever comes my way. If you have any exciting ideas to share, don't hesitate to reach out, as I am all ears! Let's explore the possibilities together.</p>
